Welcome! This is a book aimed at those who are interested in learning about the
algorithms that go into numerical methods and techniques, but want to get to the good
stuff quickly. This book is very much inspired by [Bayesian Methods for
Hackers](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/),
although it is nowhere near the stature or excellence of that work.

If you haven't checked `bmh` out, do yourself a favour and check it out!

# Current Status

This book is very much a work-in-progress (as can be seen from the commit
history; I hopped from the venerable [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to
the beatific [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) in order to
_one day_ enable interactivity).
This also means that any pull requests, suggestions or edits are absolutely welcome!
Due to the constraints of spacetime, I cannot promise that I will get to them right
away, but rest assured that I will get to them eventually.
